# React App for Restaurant Data Vissuazation with Flask Backend

Please visit https://restaurant-viz.herokuapp.com/ for a live demo. (Currently not working because of some same server dyno issues?)

I used React for frontend, Recharts as the graphing library, very basic DatetimePicker, React-tabs for the naviagtion and mostly Pandas
for dealing with the csv data.
